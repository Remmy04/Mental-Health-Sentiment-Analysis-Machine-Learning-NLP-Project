# 📊 Data Analytics & Machine Learning (DAML)

This repository contains my work from the **Data Analytics & Machine Learning** module, focusing on practical applications of **machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP)** using Python and Google Colab.

Throughout the course, I learned how to clean real-world datasets, build ML and DL models, perform NLP preprocessing, evaluate performance metrics, and apply AI techniques to solve meaningful problems.
